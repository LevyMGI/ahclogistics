      <h2>Helping You Fill the Gaps</h2>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
      <p>When it comes to RFPs, we’ll prepare those documents and distribute them to carriers, as well as analyze the returned rates to award your lanes to the appropriate partners based on your specific criteria.</p>
      <p>As for cost analysis, we’ll analyze your inbound and outbound freight costs to determine if you’re getting the best value for your freight dollars. That exercise often leads to a process evaluation in which we do a thorough analysis of your supply chain,  helping you identify areas that need improvement, as well as show you how to increase efficiency.</p>
